                 It affects the wood structure of vines, leading to black streaking in the vascular tissue and the formation of white rot. Symptoms include tiger-striped leaves, stunted growth, and eventual vine death.
                 The disease spreads through contaminated pruning tools and infected nursery stock. Management practices focus on preventive measures such as sanitizing tools, avoiding pruning during wet conditions, and removing and destroying infected vines.  
                 There are no effective chemical treatments, making vineyard hygiene and careful monitoring essential for controlling ESCA.

                  Foliar Symptoms:
                  Tiger-Striping:

                  Leaves display interveinal chlorosis (yellowing) with green veins, creating a "tiger-stripe" pattern.
                  Necrotic spots may form within the chlorotic areas, turning brown and brittle.
                  Leaf Burn:

                  Margins of leaves may show scorching or burn-like symptoms, eventually leading to leaf drop.
                  Wood Symptoms:
                  Black Streaking:

                  Dark streaks or black spots appear in the vascular tissues of the wood, often visible when the trunk or canes are cut.
                  White Rot:

                  Advanced infection leads to the formation of a soft, spongy white rot in the heartwood, compromising the vine's structural integrity.
                  Fruit Symptoms:
                  Berry Discoloration:
                  Infected berries may show spots or discoloration.
                  Berries may shrivel and fall off prematurely.

Smallpox pustules look the same as each other, while the chickenpox rash develops in waves. The individual spots don’t look the same and some form scabs while others are still blistering. \n There’s another important difference.
