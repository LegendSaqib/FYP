                 The disease spreads via wind-borne spores, which infect grapevine leaves, shoots, and berries, especially during wet weather.
                 Management practices include ensuring good air circulation through proper pruning, removing infected plant debris, and applying fungicides. 
                 Resistant grape varieties and precise timing of chemical treatments based on weather forecasts also help control the disease.
                Effective monitoring and integrated pest management are crucial for minimizing downy mildew's impact on grapevines.""",
